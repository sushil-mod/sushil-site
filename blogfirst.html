        <h1>What Qualify as Good Commit Message ?</h1>
        <p> While we are focusing on writing codes and Building apps , we often push code without carring the commit messages and thats where the problem starts. In future ,when we try to access code or its meaning we get confused so, Writing meaningful commit messages can save a lot of time answering many “why?” and “how?” questions, and thus gives us more time in the day to do productive work. </p>

        <h3>Why Is a Good Commit Message Important?</h3>
        <p>Basically, when are using github there is need to communicate between team members and also for our future reference.Let’s say there’s a bug in the application which was not there before. To find out what caused the problem, reading the commit messages could be handy. The proper commit message can save a great deal of time finding the recent changes related to a bug.  </p>
        <p>If we fix a bug or add a feature we will probably completely forget about it a month or two later. It’s not a good idea to think that if it’s not clear for others, they can ask us about it. Instead, we should provide proper commit messages for people to use as a resource in their daily work.</p>

        <h3>What Is a Good Commit Message?</h3>
        <p>Good commit messages can be written in many different styles.As many companies have their own way to write commits messages for their code.  </p>
        <p>The commit message may have certain qualities :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Feat- a new feature</li>
            <li>Fix- a bug fix</li>
            <li>Docs- changes in documentation</li>
            <li>Style- everything related to styling</li>
            <li>Refactor- code changes that neither fixes a bug without adding  a feature</li>
            <li>Test- everything related to testing</li>
            <li>Chore- updating build tasks, package manager configuration, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A great format for writing commit messages can be different in each team for different companies . The most important aspect is to keep it simple and readable.</p>
