        <h1>Editors for Javascript</h1>
        <p> In this blog, we are going to take a look at some great JavaScript editors that I have used for building project or for programming.we will discuss briefly about  editors </p>
        <h3>Visual Studio</h3>
        <p>This open-source editor is available for Linux, Windows, and macOS and also  support enables automatic completions while the user is coding in HTML, CSS, JS, or PHP . On top of that, the editor generates both native and managed code. As for JS, this code editor gives built-in support. Some other features include  Node.js, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>The built-in Git support allows you to run commands like publish, commit, push, pull, and rebase. Apart from that, you can customize and extend Visual Studio Code with additional features and plugins.</p>
        <h3>Sublime </h3>
        <p>Sublime Text is another open-source JS editor. Itâ€™s cross-platform, which offers a lot of room for customizing. The interface is free of any clutter. So that makes the editor user-friendly. Some of its great features include an impressive speed boost and improved pane management. Go to Symbol and Go to Definition are some other features. You can also download packages such as SideBar Enhancements for copy, paste, move, and rename.</p>
        <p>The best part is that you can try all the features you want free of cost. This JS editor also offers a trial version so that developers can have an insight into how it works. Once the trial period is over, for accessing the complete features, you have to pay aertain amount for  usage.</p>
